### Welcome to ScratchIt
This is a website that is useless, so scratch the screen, this is useless!
I just want to say, check out Catphoria on Scratch
https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Catphoria/
I make scratch projects that are kinda kool. See what I did there, K instead of C. Im funny, right?! Thanks for checking this out btw, I will put some info up on here about how I am doing. How bout you tell people bout this site, because that would be funny and a big waste of there time, and yours, a little. Also they get to know about me, which is funny!
## How I am doing...

I'm fine. Released the site, and bored! Also made a scratch account... but I used to play scratch so I know how to code in it. I hope to make some good projects.
